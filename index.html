        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Chris Shurr regularly eats pudding using the lid of the container. She's had an illustrious career as a software dev starting in September of 2022 to current day. Many didn't believe she would make it this far, herself included. She said her rolemodel is Garfield, sharing his prickly disposition, anger towards the start of a new week, and an all-consuming love for lasagna.</p>
